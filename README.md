# Palestine Plugin

The Palestine Plugin helps connect people with web-based Palestine resources.

## Tools for Crowdsourcing Palestine Research

The Palestine Plugin makes it easier to contribute information to Palestine-related projects.

Currently, the Palestine Plugin integrates with:

- [Zionism Observer](https://zionism.observer): Plugin assists with archiving quotes from Israeli officials and public figures
- [Palestine Love](https://palestinelove.org): Plugin assists with contributing websites related to Palestine

If you represent a Palestine related project that has a public-facing form that gathers web-based resources, please let us know if you would like your project included in the plugin using the Github issues queue.

## Tools for Discovery

Coming soon. Our roadmap of features includes:

- Enhancing websites visited with additional links to Palestine-related resources, when relevant
- Options to follow Palestine-related social media through the plugin, when visiting a social network
- Links to Palestine-related websites
